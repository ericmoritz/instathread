    <h1>instathread</h1>


    <p>Instathread is a service to enable quick ad-hoc "protected" discussion threads.</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>

    <p>You create the thread, share the private URL with your friends, and
      discuss.  The discussion is as private as the URL is so keep that in
      mind.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>Sometimes you need to have a quick discussion about something without
      SPAMing your email or SPAM Twitter or Facebook with a trivial
      conversation.  Need to discuss lunch plans? Instathread it.</p>

    <h2>But what if I want to archive the conversation?</h2>
    <p>I don't know, print it, do a save-as or use some other service.</p>
